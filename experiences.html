          <p style="text-align: justify;margin-left: 5%;">For my first co-op term, I reached out to a Psychology professor whom I had built a rapport with after taking her class. I was hired as a summer <b>research assistant</b> to assist the graduate students with their research studies in a cognitive neuroscience lab.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;margin-left: 5%;">At first, my responsibilities involved going through recorded videos of previous studies and using software to pinpoint the ROIs (regions of interest) on the researcher's face; these areas include the eyes, nose, mouth, face, and background. In an ongoing research study, the graduate student had individuals with autism participate while wearing eye-tracking technology to detect where they were looking. Researchers hypothesized that people with autism tended to make less eye contact when interacting with others. Once I added the different ROIs to the video, the software would be able to detect where the participant fixated and for how many times.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">The bulk of my work term consisted of running EEG data through a pipeline on MATLAB. This data was from a previous study where the participants' brain responses were recorded. The participants were shown happy faces, angry faces, and faces with no expression (neutral) while completing certain tasks (i.e. identify gender, emotion, etc.). The results of this study demonstrated faster reaction times for faces that were angry and thus, a sensitivity to threat (or perceived threat) in the environment. I fixed a lot of bugs and technical errors along the way and amended the pipeline for future use. I also created a manual containing my process and instructions for future research assistants or any lab member who was interested. After successfully running all the data through the pipeline, I used EEGLAB to manually pick out and remove brain data that had been disrupted by noise or the surrounding environment. Finally, I used SPSS to analyze and interpret the findings before discussing them with my supervisor.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Some other responsibilities I was tasked with was helping graduate students run their studies. In one study, I ran participants through a 1.5 hour study using eye-tracking technology. In this study, we told participants they would be shown a series of faces and then tested on their memory of them after. The purpose of this study was to observe where on the face the participants focused on while trying to "encode" the faces for a later recognition test. I would also assist other graduate students set up and apply an EEG cap to participants using electrodes and gel on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<br>
<br>
        <h4 style="color:#1d685f;">Co-op Term 2 - D2L</h4>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">I found my second co-op position through the university's co-op system, WaterlooWorks. I was hired by D2L as a <b>UX research assistant</b>. D2L is a cloud company that creates learning management systems (LMS) for schools and businesses -in fact, one of their customers is the University of Waterloo.
        Alongside the two full time UX researchers, my team consisted of product designers. The designers designed the system, conducted usability studies with customers, and worked closely with the respective engineers. I had a few administrative tasks which included enrolling the participants through Qualtrics, scheduling visits, sending NDAs, and generally being the point of contact for all participants.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A large part of my work term consisted of analyzing the data we obtained from usability tests or interviews. I did this for multiple designers who were each designing a different aspect of the LMS as well as for the project the UX researchers were working on. The research team worked on creating personas that represented our customers and their needs in order to generate empathy between the engineers working in the back-end of the system and the users they were unable to meet. This was also a good reminder for everyone that at the end of our system, real people were using our features and products. By the end of the study, we had over 70 participants and a lot of responses. Since there was a lot of data, I used RStudio to cluster participants into three groups based on response similarity. These would then become the personas that would represent our customers, their education, roles, needs, challenges, likes, dislikes, etc.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Before carrying out data analysis for the designers, I attended the usability tests to take notes beforehand and noted down anything that seemed significant. Since there were only a maximum of 10 participants in each study, I manually analyzed the data using Excel. First, if the questions generated qualitative responses, I would categorize the questions in a way that I could simply analyze the data. For example, using a binary method where '0' represented the participant disagreeing or voicing they did not need a certain feature an inability to complete the task and '1' represented the participant agreeing or voicing they thought a certain feature would be nice to have, etc. the ability to complete the task. If the questions in the study generated quantitative responses (i.e. "On a scale of 1-5 how important..."), I used a similar method with Excel but calculated the total for each categorized question. Further, in every usability test, we had participants test out the product by asking them to complete certain tasks. I would always use a binary method to analyze this completion or incompletion (where '0' represented the inability to complete the task and '1' represented the ability to complete the task). If there were ending comments at the end (suggestions for improvement, nice-to-haves, etc.), I would take them into consideration as well. After creating the spreadsheet, I could then visually see the areas in which the participants struggled the most in and identify trends. In other words, I could summarize and highlight their pain points, needs, and likes before presenting them to the designer and suggesting iteration changes. I would also visually present the findings to engineers by putting together a slide deck. Lastly, I created a new SOP for new hires that contained our updated processes, tools, and information.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">One notable experience I had while working for D2L was being able to attend the Brightspace Symposium at Algonquin College in Ottawa. I attended a few panels and took notes for the research team as well as conducted a few semi-structured interviews with professors. The purpose was to find out more about their work process and how we could facilitate it in their day-to-day life.</p> 
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, this was a significant experience for me because it opened my eyes to options outside of academia research. Of course, the skills I learned from working in research labs at the university were transferable. However, I realized after this work term that it was possible to work in the tech industry with a degree in Psychology.</p>
